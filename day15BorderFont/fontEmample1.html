    <h1>The font property</h1>
    <p style="color:#000000">This is a paragraph. The default text color was black, but I added a paragraph selector and defined the color property so it's navy. You'll see that the paragraph below is alos navy, exceept for the link. Using a separate selector, the color of links hass been changed to aqua.
