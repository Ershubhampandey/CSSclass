    <p>Hearing a knock on the door,  she hustled towards it with her  little feet, her lips uncloaking the cutest smile and her voice singing, "Daddy's home!" Her mum, glued to the news channels for the past week, approached the door hesitantly and opened it with trepidation.Two men in military uniform were standing at the doorstep. One of them handed her an envelope with a mournful expression, adding plaintively, "We're sorry, Mrs Bhatt.""Where's my dad, Uncle? He promised we'll celebrate Diwali together this time," exclaimed the girl. They stared helplessly, with a lump in their throats and moistened eyes.</p>
